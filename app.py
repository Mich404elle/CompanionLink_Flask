General Guidelines:
1. The goal of the Companion Call program is to socialize and build meaningful friendships.
2. Throughout your time with CompanionLink, adhere to your volunteer rights and responsibilities and act within the limits of your volunteer role.
3. Do not give advice or meet your companion in person.
4. If you are uncertain about what to do, reach out to CompanionLink's Volunteer Coordinator for guidance.
5. Keep copies of the Volunteer Handbook & Agreements and review them as often as you need to.
6. If a Breach of Confidentiality does occur, then contact your Supervisor immediately.

Do's:
Communicate effectively
    1. Introduce yourself each time.
    2. Speak clearly and annunciate carefully.
    3. Be patient. Listen as your companion speaks at their own pace.
Accommodate as necessary
    1. Check or ask if your companion uses assistance devices. 
    2. Connect via video calls where possible to leverage non-verbal communication such as facial expressions, hand gestures and lip movements.
    3. Write or type on a whiteboard using ultra-large font.
Foster a positive, friendly atmosphere
    1. Be kind, smile, and use friendly tone of voice.
    2. Go with the flow and have fun!
    3. Always end the call with, "Talk to you next week!"

Don'ts:
You should not:
    1. Interrupt or correct your companion.
    2. Yell or use an impatient tone of voice. 
    3. Use Elderspeak (a patronizing style of speech that conveys incompetence, dependence, and control, with the effect of infantilizing the older adult).
